= Introduction =

How to create your first EasyPhpApp project.


= Details =

Get the [http://framework.zend.com/download/overview Zend Framework] library. The last snapshot should work with EasyPhpApp.

Download the last *EasyPhpApp tarball* and untar it. You can also checkout the [http://code.google.com/p/easyphpapp/source/list SVN repository].

Look at the *./examples* folder.

[http://code.google.com/p/easyphpapp/source/browse/#svn/trunk/easyphpapp/examples/autoadvformapp autoadvformapp] is a typical EasyPhpApp form example.

[http://code.google.com/p/easyphpapp/source/browse/#svn/trunk/easyphpapp/examples/recordapp recordapp] shows the 'grid' implementation.

[http://code.google.com/p/easyphpapp/source/browse/#svn/trunk/easyphpapp/examples/routeapp routeapp] shows how to make internal URLs.

Just set up the *./examples/conf/config.php*.

Play with the examples.

Have fun.
