EASYPHPAPP :
Many times we need little PHP applications doing the same kind of job : searching, listing, editing records (CRUD = Create Read Update Delete).
EasyPhpApp is an answer to help produce scaffold applications.
EasyPhpApp is written on top of Zend Framework/PHP components and is designed to be easily used by non web developpers and easy to maintain.

FEATURES :
 - Clean but simple MVC approach : the framework uses structured url (routes) to target modules (your application classes) and actions (methods of the classes)
 - Strong but simple security layer : build on top of Zend_Auth and Zend_Acl
 - Can be HTML free : build your presentation only with layouts classes
 - Form supports : file upload, radio buttons, automatic inputs values storage, etc
 - Grid : generic table of records implementation
 - PRG + CRUD
 - Data model support : generate form and list from table 

INSTALL :
 - Get the Zend Framework library. The last snapshot should work with EasyPhpApp.
 - Download the last EasyPhpApp tarball and untar it. You can also checkout the SVN repository.

QUICKSTART :
 - Look at the ./examples folder.
 - Just copy ./examples/conf/config-dist.php to ./examples/conf/config.php and set up the includes path.
 - Play with the examples (autoformapp is a good start).
